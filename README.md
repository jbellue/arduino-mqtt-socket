# arduino-mqtt-socket

Control an mains socket with an ESP8266 (in my case, a Wemos D1 mini clone) connected to a mosquitto broker

TODO:
- [x] Add a page to setup what can be setup
- [ ] Store broker data into EEPROM
- [x] Add a WiFi portal to set up the connection if the wifi is unreachable
- [ ] Betterify
