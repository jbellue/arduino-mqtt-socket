# arduino-mqtt-socket

Control an mains socket with an ESP8266 (in my case, a Wemos D1 mini clone) connected to a mosquitto broker

TODO:
* Add a page to setup what can be setup (for now, just the topic, but that could change)
* Add a WiFi portal to set up the connection if the wifi is unreachable
* Betterify
